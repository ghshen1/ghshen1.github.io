Welcome to my homepage! 

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). My research interests lie in statistical machine learning and nonparametric statistics, focusing on the foundations of deep learning including generalization, approximation, and perhaps optimization. I have recently been interested in deep reinforcement learning in theory and application.

Openings are available for undergrad interns/student helpers and research assistants/associates. Feel free to email your CV to me if you are interested in my research.
